# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline in details
Understanding Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for LLMs and Multi-modal AI.

Due to security/privacy concerns over using Chatmodels on sensitive datas, It is not recommended to train the model using private sensitive datas.

Therefore, RAG pipeline is used for extracting relevant infos from sensitive datas, without requiring to train the model again. And later, LLM can easily process the query and relevant documents to provide proper answers. 
This method is very effective in terms of cost, time, resource and accuracy.
